Dear Appeals Department:

I am writing to formally appeal the denial of claim CLM-2025-001.

DENIAL REASON CITED: "Charges exceed fair market value and Medicare rates"

PROCEDURE: Multiple procedures (MRI brain, colonoscopy, knee replacement)

GROUNDS FOR APPEAL:
Medical bill analysis shows 55% overcharging compared to Medicare rates and fair market value. MRI brain billed $6,500 vs $3,500 expected. Colonoscopy billed $4,500 vs $3,000 expected. Knee replacement billed $76,500 vs $50,000 expected. Total overcharge: $31,000.

Under ERISA Section 503 (29 U.S.C. § 1133), I request:

Please respond within 30 days as required by law.

Sincerely,
John Smith
